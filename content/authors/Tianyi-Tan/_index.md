I am a third-year undergraduate student in Xingjian College, Tsinghua University, majoring in theoretical and applied mechanics. I am also working at Institute for AI Industry Research, Tsinghua university, as a research intern, advised by Prof. Xianyuan Zhan. My research interest lies in autonomous driving and robotics, as well as generative models. Feel free to engage with me in discussions related to these fields!:)
