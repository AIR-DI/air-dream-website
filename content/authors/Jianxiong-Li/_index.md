Hi! I am currently a 4th-year PhD candidate at [Institude for AI Industry Research (AIR)](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) and [School of Vehicle and Mobility, Tsinghua University](http://www.svm.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.html), advised by [Prof. Xianyuan Zhan](http://zhanxianyuan.xyz/) and [Prof. Ya-Qin Zhang](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1046/1188.htm). I got my bachelor’s degree in June 2021 from the School of Mechanical Engineering, [Xi’an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/).

My dream is to develop robots that are **universally deployable** across diverse real-world environments. Towards this goal, my current work primarily focused on:

- (**Efficient Pretrain**) How to build robotic foundation models efficiently when robotics data are limited?
- (**Fast Post-train**) How to fastly enhance robot peformance given limited budget?
- (**RL+X**) How to use RL to reach super-human performance on diverse domains, like robots, VLMs or LLMs?
