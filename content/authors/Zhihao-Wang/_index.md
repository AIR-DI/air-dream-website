I am currently a first-year master's student at the College of Engineering ([CoE](https://en.coe.pku.edu.cn/)), Peking University, advised by Professor [Junzhi Yu](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278401500) (IEEE Fellow).

I am also a research intern at the Institute for AI Research (AIR), Tsinghua University, advised by Professor Xianyuan Zhan.

Prior to that, I earned my B.Eng. degree in Intelligent Automotive Engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology ([HIT](http://en.hit.edu.cn/)).
