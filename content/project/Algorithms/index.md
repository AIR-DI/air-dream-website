A main research direction for the AIR-DREAM Lab is to develop high-performance, robust, generalizable, and real-world deployable data-driven decision-making algorithms. We are specifically interested in offline policy learning methods, such as offline reinforcement learning (RL), offline imitation learning (IL), and offline planning, which enable a simulation-free and low-cost solution to address many real-world problems. 

Our current research focus include:
- Sample-efficient / high-generalization offline RL / IL / planning algorithms
- Foundation models for decision-making
- Safe offline RL algorithms
- Hybrid RL that combines offline and online policy learning
- Offline policy learning under imperfect reward
- Feedback-efficient RLHF
