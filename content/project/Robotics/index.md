We focus on developing robotic control and autonomous driving policy learning methods that could directly learn from real-world data, bypassing or alleviating sim-to-real gap, while achieving robust and generalizable performance. 


Our current research focus include:
- Offline RL / IL / planning methods for autonomous driving and robotic control
- Offline policy optimization for safety-critical scenarios
- Foundation models for robotic control
- Sim-to-real adaptation
