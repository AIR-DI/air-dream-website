We provide open code implementations for most of our research, please check our papers for related codes. In addition, we aim to develop easy-to-use and comprehensive algorithm libraries and tools to accelerate the real-world deployment of advanced data-driven decision-making methods.

## Data-Drivien Decision-Making Libraries / Tools
- [Data-Driven Control Lib (D2C)](https://github.com/AIR-DI/D2C): is a data-driven decision-making algorithm library designed for solving real-world control/optimization problems. It implements a series of advanced offline RL/IL algorithms and provide easy-to-use tools & utilities to facilitate real-world deployment. 

## Online RL library
